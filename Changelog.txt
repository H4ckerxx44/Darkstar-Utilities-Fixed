##TURN GRAPHICS SETTINGS TO HIGH##

Amount of items currently added = 324
Amount of entities currently added = 161
Amount of technology currently added = 119
Total Sum = 604

This mod was designed along with the Big Bags mod. Item recipes and Ammo amounts where balanced around the higher stack sizes given by Big Bags. Although this mod will work without Big Bags I do not suggest it, for many aspects will not work as intended. 

This is a very large mod. file sizes inside this mod exceed what the game can render on normal graphics settings. TURN GRAPHICS SETTINGS TO HIGH. Currently, the low spec version of the mod will not be updated until later. Updating two versions of this mod at once requires more time than I have to give currently. Perhaps in the future I will once again update the low spec versions.

Big thanks to Azakir for helping alone the way. 
Thanks to Expanded Rocket Payloads, I had to reference their code for the *empty rocket* message.

Feel free to edit and re-upload the mod with new or altered features, however give due credit.

Change Log:
---------------------------------------
##0.19.9 Coal Mining Probe
##Added:##
Coal Mining Probe

Internal buffer for Mining Probes is now 5000 instead of 500

---------------------------------------
##0.19.8 Typos!
##Fixed:##
Fixed various typos

---------------------------------------
##0.19.7 It's back!
##Fixed:##
Properly package the mod for release

---------------------------------------
##0.19.6 Actually fixing an issue?
##Fixed:##
An issue that prevented the game from showing the mod in the mod menu has hopefully been fixed in this update.

---------------------------------------
##0.19.5 A failure to fix an issue
Attempted to fix an issue, I failed

---------------------------------------
##0.19.4 Update to 1.1

##Changed:##
Items not fully implemented have a warning in the description.

---------------------------------------
##0.19.3 Revisions to old systems
##Important:##
The game will give a warning about a removed recipe, this is intended and should not be confused for an issue.
From here on, all items added by Darkstar Utilities which are Productivity Module compatible will be denoted with a |P| in the description

##Added:##
Star Core Matter and HS Star Core Matter can be formed into Lithium Ore
Uranium Processing Recipe
Efficiency Beacon

##Fixed:##
Copper Mining Probe MK2 now gives Dense Ore
Laser Drills now deposit mined ore on the side of the belt the Drill is placed on, rather than the opposing side
Objects now have correct amounts of health

##Changed:##
Star Core Matter and HS Star Core Matter have both been largely buffed
Both Uranium probes now give Dense Uranium Ore
Uranium Probes now pollute for 75 instead of 1075
Following items now allow for Productivity Modules:
Empty Regulator
Module Component
Solar Wafer
Advanced Photovoltaic Cells
Filter Tray and Sand Filter Tray
Flywheel
Antimony, Selenium, Tellurium, Silver, Platinum, Ciusitral, Lithusarium, Rhusanthium and Lithium Steel Composite Plates
Power Boost Beacon now gives 2.5x effectivity
Lowered Ultra Beacon power usage from 75MW to 50MW
Boosted Ultra Beacon effectivity to 50% from 45%
Power Boost Beacon range increased from 1 to 2, mostly helps visualize what it can touch
Any-Cast Beacon now gives 50% up from 25% effectivity
Any-Cast Beacon supply range increased to 8 from 5
Buffed Efficiency Modules by .2



##Extra Information:##
Star Matter yields were changed in a hope to balance them more against Probs and Quarries
Uranium Probes have been changed for a multitude of reasons. Them now giving "Dense ore" alligns it with the other level 2 Probes. Additionally it allowed me to require sulfuric acid for the processing of Dense Uranium to make the process more similar to vanilla. 

##0.19.2 Actual Additions again
##Added:##
RTG, RTG-MK2 and RTG-MK3

##Changed:##
Geothermal Generator MK3 no longer requires energy liquid to unlock or craft
S-REG Units have all been massively buffed
ANCT Generators have been buffed
Increased time taken for Dense Ore to be produced from Probes to 3 from 1
Furnace Warehouse now consume 4MW instead of 45MW
Laser Forges look slightly different to help differentiate them from default game furnaces
Massive Graphical upgrade to Eden Biodome
Restructured the technology tree a little so that generator objects require the third level of previous types to unlock, now having a more even and logical "Ladder" of progression

##Fixed:##
Roboports should now use the correct amount of energy
Biodome is no longer highly confusing/annoying
finally fixed the rotation/hitbox issues for following items:
S-REG Units
Furnace Warehouse
Ore Extractor
ANCT Generators
If I missed an object with this issue, please notify me on either Twitter, Discord, or the Mod Page


##Extra Information:##
I changed the Geothermal Generator MK3's recipe to make room for an intermittent level Generator between Geothermal and S-REG
I absolutely plan on updating the Laser Forge textures later, but before then and now I've decided to lazily update the visuals

---------------------------------------
##0.19.1 Bugfix
##Added:##
Filter Tray
Sand Filter Tray

##Fixed:##
Filters no longer infinitely produce Empty Filters when used
Vacuum Chamber can now utilize Speed and Efficiency Modules
Actually Fixed S-REG Technology names

##Changed:##
Specialty Alloy recipe costs massively reduced
Reduced Smelting time for Selenium, Tellurium, Antimony, Silver and Platinum by 75%
Reduced Geothermal Generator MK3 Recipe to only require 1 Energy Liquid 
Empty Regulator Recipe Tweaked
All Filter Charge Recipes
Vacuum Chamber Module slots reduced to 2 from 4
Any-Cast Beacon energy cost reduced again from 10MW to 5MW
Removed Iron Plate from Energy Liquid recipes

##Extra Information:##
The reason I decided to change filter recipes (again) is due to the limits of belts. Now, each component in the production chain for Filters only takes up 2 items instead of 3. This in theory should allow you to double production rate. This change also lowered the aggressive requirements to be a decent bit more tame. This does mean Filter Arrays will need updating to work again.
The new Filter Items are the first to have 64x Textures, in the future I plan on updating more of the mod's textures to be higher resolution.

---------------------------------------
##0.19.0 Escaping the 0.18s!

Tweaked Solar Flare Lamp Recipe
Mini-Lamps now give 4 per Craft Cycle
Mini-Lamp brightness and radius increased
Decreased Warhouse Steel Plate requirement to 60 from 120
Long Underground Belt recipes reduced from 8 ro 6


---------------------------------------
##0.18.9  A small hotfix update
##Fixed##
S-REG Technology names were incorrectly labeled
ANCT Generators now require all three S-REG technologies to unlock
Vacuum Chamber Research now gives the "Leaded Glass" recipe

##Added##
New Technology and recipes for filtering dirt for metallic resources
 
---------------------------------------
##0.18.8##
##Fixed##

Vacuum Chamber component parts can now be crafted in hand
Dense Ore can be cracked into usable ore
Tweaked a name to allow more compatibility with Bob's mods
Fixed some hitboxing issues with the Extraction Machine

---------------------------------------
##0.18.7##
Some important notes before I do my best at labeling everything. This update in it's current state is not a final product by any means, it's intended to let people play the mod in 1.0 even though, strictly speaking, it isn't finished. Things 'should' work as intended lest I missed something, but textures and such might be a bit wonky. I plan on eventually replacing the rest of the textures that need to be, for example the 4 ships have horrible model work and need to be changed.

With that out of the way, this is a complete overhaul of the entire mod's progression and function from the start to the end of the game. A system for space station construction is in the works, but currently serves little purpose and needs more features added to become viable, let alone entertaining.  I've lowered the amount of weapons in the game, this is not a permanent change but rather a way to transition into more interesting weapons once I fully implement required features for them. One last thing, Space Station additions will be mentioned in a space of their own for simplicity.
