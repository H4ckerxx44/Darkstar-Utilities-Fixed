---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.19.3
Date: ??.??.????
  Important:
    - The game will give a warning about a removed recipe, this is intended and should not be confused for an issue.
    - From here on, all items added by Darkstar Utilities which are Productivity Module compatible will be denoted with a |P| in the description

  Additions:
    - Star Core Matter and HS Star Core Matter can be formed into Lithium Ore
    - Uranium Processing Recipe
    - Efficiency Beacon

  Fixes:
    - Copper Mining Probe MK2 now gives Dense Ore
    - Laser Drills now deposit mined ore on the side of the belt the Drill is placed on, rather than the opposing side
    - Objects now have correct amounts of health

  Changes:
    - Star Core Matter and HS Star Core Matter have both been largely buffed
    - Both Uranium probes now give Dense Uranium Ore
    - Uranium Probes now pollute for 75 instead of 1075
    - Empty Regulator now allows for Productivity Modules
    - Module Component now allows for Productivity Modules

    - Advanced Photovoltaic Cells now allows for Productivity Modules
    - Filter Tray and Sand Filter Tray now allows for Productivity Modules
    - Flywheel now allows for Productivity Modules
    - Antimony, Selenium, Tellurium, Silver, Platinum, Ciusitral, Lithusarium, Rhusanthium and Lithium Steel Composite Plates now allow for Productivity Modules
    - Power Boost Beacon now gives 2.5x effectivity
    - Lowered Ultra Beacon power usage from 75MW to 50MW
    - Boosted Ultra Beacon effectivity to 50% from 45%
    - Power Boost Beacon range increased from 1 to 2, mostly helps visualize what it can touch
    - Any-Cast Beacon now gives 50% up from 25% effectivity
    - Any-Cast Beacon supply range increased to 8 from 5
    - Buffed Efficiency Modules by 0.2

  Extra Information:
    - Star Matter yields were changed in a hope to balance them more against Probs and Quarries
    - Uranium Probes have been changed for a multitude of reasons. Them now giving "Dense ore" alligns it with the other level 2 Probes. Additionally it allowed me to require sulfuric acid for the processing of Dense Uranium to make the process more similar to vanilla.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.19.2
Date: ??.??.????
  Additions:
    - RTG, RTG-MK2 and RTG-MK3

  Fixes:
    - Roboports should now use the correct amount of energy
    - Biodome is no longer highly confusing/annoying
    - Hitbox of S-REG Units got fixed
    - Hitbox of Furnace Warehouse got fixed
    - Hitbox of Ore Extractor got fixed
    - Hitbox of ANCT Generators got fixed

  Changes:
    - Geothermal Generator MK3 no longer requires energy liquid to unlock or craft
    - S-REG Units have all been massively buffed
    - ANCT Generators have been buffed
    - Increased time taken for Dense Ore to be produced from Probes to 3 from 1
    - Furnace Warehouse now consume 4MW instead of 45MW
    - Laser Forges look slightly different to help differentiate them from default game furnaces
    - Massive Graphical upgrade to Eden Biodome
    - Restructured the technology tree a little so that generator objects require the third level of previous types to unlock, now having a more even and logical "Ladder" of progression

  Extra Information:
    - If I missed an object with this issue, please notify me on either Twitter, Discord, or the Mod Page
    - I changed the Geothermal Generator MK3's recipe to make room for an intermittent level Generator between Geothermal and S-REG
    - I absolutely plan on updating the Laser Forge textures later, but before then and now I've decided to lazily update the visuals

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.19.1
Date: ??.??.????
  Additions:
    - Filter Tray
    - Sand Filter Tray

  Fixes:
    - Filters no longer infinitely produce Empty Filters when used
    - Vacuum Chamber can now utilize Speed and Efficiency Modules
    - Actually Fixed S-REG Technology names

  Changes:
    - Specialty Alloy recipe costs massively reduced
    - Reduced Smelting time for Selenium, Tellurium, Antimony, Silver and Platinum by 75%
    - Reduced Geothermal Generator MK3 Recipe to only require 1 Energy Liquid
    - Empty Regulator Recipe Tweaked
    - All Filter Charge Recipes
    - Any-Cast Beacon energy cost reduced again from 10MW to 5MW
    - Vacuum Chamber Module slots reduced to 2 from 4
    - Removed Iron Plate from Energy Liquid recipes

  Extra Information:
    - The reason I decided to change filter recipes (again) is due to the limits of belts. Now, each component in the production chain for Filters only takes up 2 items instead of 3. This in theory should allow you to double production rate. This change also lowered the aggressive requirements to be a decent bit more tame. This does mean Filter Arrays will need updating to work again.
    - The new Filter Items are the first to have 64x Textures, in the future I plan on updating more of the mod's textures to be higher resolution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Mini-Lamp brightness and radius increased
    - Decreased Warhouse Steel Plate requirement to 60 from 120
    - Long Underground Belt recipes reduced from 8 ro 6

  Extra Information:

  Changes:
    - Around 80% to 90% of current recipes
    - Tons of small Balancing
    - A decent amount of models and textures
    - Entire progression tree
    - And the mod should be nearly fully colorblind friendly

  Extra Information:
    - Some important notes before I do my best at labeling everything. This update in it's current state is not a final product by any means, it's intended to let people play the mod in 1.0 even though, strictly speaking, it isn't finished. Things 'should' work as intended lest I missed something, but textures and such might be a bit wonky. I plan on eventually replacing the rest of the textures that need to be, for example the 4 ships have horrible model work and need to be changed.
    - With that out of the way, this is a complete overhaul of the entire mod's progression and function from the start to the end of the game. A system for space station construction is in the works, but currently serves little purpose and needs more features added to become viable, let alone entertaining.  I've lowered the amount of weapons in the game, this is not a permanent change but rather a way to transition into more interesting weapons once I fully implement required features for them. One last thing, Space Station additions will be mentioned in a space of their own for simplicity.
