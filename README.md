This mod was designed along with the Big Bags mod. Item recipes and Ammo amounts where balanced around the higher stack sizes given by Big Bags. Although this mod will work without Big Bags I do not suggest it, for many aspects will not work as intended.

This is a very large mod. file sizes inside this mod exceed what the game can render on normal graphics settings. TURN GRAPHICS SETTINGS TO HIGH. Currently, the low spec version of the mod will not be updated until later. Updating two versions of this mod at once requires more time than I have to give currently. Perhaps in the future I will once again update the low spec versions.

Big thanks to Azakir for helping alone the way.
Thanks to Expanded Rocket Payloads, I had to reference their code for the *empty rocket* message.

Feel free to edit and re-upload the mod with new or altered features, however give due credit.

Propel yourself all the way from mining stone with your hands to ripping holes in reality. Darkstar Aims to extend the playtime of the game to well over twice the standard. With extra features like
Quarries and Ore Probes for mining in lands with no ores, or launching rockets to mine deep space material. With roughly 664 currently added features!

This repository was made by me because

1. The original mod author [Nekomancer](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Nekomancer) had no repository
2. I fixed some typos and will - probably - continue to do so, don't expect new major features from me. This is the first time of me touching lua.

Feel free to fork this!
