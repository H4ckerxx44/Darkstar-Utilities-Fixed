This repository was made by me because

1. The original mod author [Nekomancer](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Nekomancer) had no repository
2. I fixed some typos and will - probably - continue to do so, don't expect new major features from me. This is the first time of me touching lua.

Feel free to fork this!
